# Fast-Modular-Exponentiation-Algorithm
This repo contains the Fast Modular Exponentiation Algorithm that calculates the mod N of an Integer A to the power of an integer B

The user is prompted to enter the integer A, B and N for calculation.

The result is then later displayed in a Table format. Showing each step to the final result.
